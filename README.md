# Test task for Alef company

## Description
This project involves developing a Vue.js web application where users can fill out personal information, including details about their children.

The form should include input fields for the user's full name and age. Below, users can add information about their children by clicking a "+" button, which displays input fields for each child's name and age. Users can add up to 5 children; once the limit is reached, the "+" button becomes disabled. Each child entry includes a "delete" button, allowing users to remove specific entries.

The application is front-end only, with no server-side functionality. When the "Save" button is clicked, the entered data is displayed on a "Preview" page.

A separate read-only page also displays the saved information without edit options.
